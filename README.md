## üöÄ Quick start
1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh    
    npm install
	ionic serve
    ```

2.  **Open in browser!**
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
	
2.  **Android and IOS build!**
	```sh        
	ionic cordova run android
	ionic cordova run ios
    ```

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.


1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
